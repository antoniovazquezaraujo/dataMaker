java data generator

A simple dummy generator using [Java Faker](https://github.com/DiUS/java-faker)  that can generate data with recursive lists of objects, for example, people with friends, of family, etc. It can manage different random levels of depth in collections and also different random sizes of collections. The only thing you need to do is mark the collections with an annotation : SelfCollection.
